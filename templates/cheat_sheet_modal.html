              <p>Markdown is a <code>lightweight markup language</code> with plain text formatting syntax. It is
                    designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.
                    Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and
                    to create rich text using a plain text editor.</p>

              <p>   At its core, Markdown is a super simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, bulleted lists,
                    and so on to plain text. It was originally designed to be an <code>easy alternative to HTML</code>,
                    and allows people to create web pages with no HTML experienceâ€”but it's also a great way to organize
                    notes, to-do lists, and other things. It has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational
                    power of a word processor. The end goal is a <code>minimalist writing system</code> that you can use to get your
                    thoughts down, and then export them elsewhere without worrying too much about the appearance.
